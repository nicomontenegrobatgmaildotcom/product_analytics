# Product_analytics
This repository contains useful information of analytics for product managers

__Problem__: A big chunk of produt managers, (and many data scientists to be honest)  are foreign to analytic techniques that support decision making. In this repository I will share information and strategies to use for product managers to actually be better at their job. 

Some of the files in this repository are:

  -AB testing: Frequentist vs Bayesian approaches
  
  -Confounders: You find out the AB test experiment was not really random. What do you do
  
  -Differnces in Differences and Synthetic controls: We launched a new product. What was the effect of this on our stock price?
  
  -What if: You want to know the effect of X action, but running an experiment is very expensive. What do you do? For example, you think the company is leaving money on the table and plan to increase prices by 10%. What           effects can we expect?
  
  -Root-cause-analysis: Our cloud architecture is experiencing a lot of latency. What do we do about it?
  
  -Marketing Mix Models: I just wanted to mention this one, but there will be a whole section dedicated to this topic, which is cool and super hard.
